    <ul>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>8 slices bacon</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step</strong> Bring a large pot
             of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook 
             spaghetti in boiling water, stirring
              occasionally, until tender yet firm to 
              the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, toss
               spaghetti with 1 tablespoon olive oil, 
               and set aside. </li>
        <li><strong>Step</strong> Place diced bacon
             in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and 
             stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain
              bacon on paper towels, reserving 2 tablespoons 
              bacon fat in the skillet. </li>
        <li><strong>Step</strong> Add 1 tablespoon olive oil
             to bacon fat in the skillet. Add chopped 
             onion and cook over medium heat until onion 
             is translucent. Add minced garlic and cook 
             until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and 
             cook 1 minute more. </li>
        <li><strong>Step</strong> Return cooked bacon to the skillet; 
            add cooked spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through,
             adding more olive oil if it seems dry or sticks 
             together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing 
             constantly with tongs or a large fork, until 
             eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan
              cheese and toss again. Season with salt and pepper 
              (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty). 
            </li>
        <li><strong>Step</strong> Serve warm with 
            chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra 
            Parmesan cheese at the table. </li>
    </ol>
